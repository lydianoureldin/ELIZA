Object-Oriented ELIZA Chatbot

An object-oriented chatbot with memory capability. Based on the first AI chatbot created, ELIZA, developed by Joseph Weizenbaum in his 1966 paper, "ELIZA — A Computer Program for the Study of Natural Language Communication between Man and Machine," Communications of the Association for Computing Machinery 9 (1966): 36-45.". I have attached the original paper here for reference. 

Please refer to the "Techinical Document" for details on the algorithm, code, and object-oriented structure. 

Instructions for running:
1. Ensure Python 3.6.0 is installed on your computer.
2. There is a script that is already in the folder called “ElizaScript.txt”. If you choose to use this file enter "ElizaScript.txt" (no “”) when prompted by the program. If you choose to use another file you can either place the text file in the same folder as the program, or provide the complete file path when prompted by the program. This script is totally optional. ELIZA will respond to the lines in the "ElizaScript.txt" then will wait for more user input. If you leave the file empty then you can start chatting with ELIZA directly right away. 
3. ELIZA will go through the script in the file first then will wait for more user input directly from the console.
4. Input "quit" (no "") when you're done chatting. 

Note: avoid using “i’m” instead of “i am” when talking to Eliza. Feel free to use “don’t”.
